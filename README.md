# hello-world
My first repo.
I've been learning python at a hobby level for a couple years now.
I use git some at work, but usually struggle with it, make mistakes, bang my head on the desk.
Now I want to get a better handle on git, so this repo.
Maybe I'll start doing some open source?

So this is an edit in a new branch
